## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Below is the output from the multiple linear regression:

- According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words, the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on the mpg values. 
- The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
- From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg predictions) is explained using this linear model. We can say that this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes quite effectively.
